\section{Problem Description}
Quantum annealing allows for solving a wide range of optimisation problems. A common description of the problems is needed to allows for easy comparison, tooling compatibility but also to determine what is solvable with the available equipment. This section discusses two most common descriptions which are interchangeable.
