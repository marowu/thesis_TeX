\section{Quantum Annealing}
Quantum annealing has some interesting properties. It is analog in nature and because the computation happens in a ground state it is unaffected by decoherence \cite{mcgeoch_adiabatic_2014}.
Quantum annealing is a computational process, an optimization metaheuristic proposed theoretically in 1988 in \cite{apolloni_numerical_1988}, as an analogy to simulated annealing, formulated five years earlier \cite{kirkpatrick_optimization_1983}. It was first simulated classically, to finally become realised in an analog hardware by D-Wave Inc. First working quantum annealer was presented in 2007 and contained 16 qubits \cite{d-wave_inc_d-wave_2007}. To fully understand the term and to develop a bottom-up intuition of the process it is best to track the gradual development of the concept.
