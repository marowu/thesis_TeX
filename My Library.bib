Quantum fluctuations cause transitions between states and thus play the same role as thermal fluctuations in the conventional approach. The idea is tested by the transverse Ising model, in which the transverse field is a function of time similar to the temperature in the conventional method. The goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian with high accuracy as quickly as possible. We have solved the time-dependent Schrödinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions. Comparison with the results of the corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum annealing leads to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use the same annealing schedule.},

	abstract = {Many problems of industrial interest are NP-complete, and quickly exhaust resources of computational devices with increasing input sizes. Quantum annealers (QA) are physical devices that aim at this class of problems by exploiting quantum mechanical properties of nature. However, they compete with efficient heuristics and probabilistic or randomised algorithms on classical machines that allow for finding approximate solutions to large NP-complete problems. While first implementations of QA have become commercially available, their practical benefits are far from fully explored. To the best of our knowledge, approximation techniques have not yet received substantial attention. In this paper, we explore how problems' approximate versions of varying degree can be systematically constructed for quantum annealer programs, and how this influences result quality or the handling of larger problem instances on given set of qubits. We illustrate various approximation techniques on both, simulations and real QA hardware, on different seminal problems, and interpret the results to contribute towards a better understanding of the real-world power and limitations of current-state and future quantum computing.},

Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed.},

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every ﬁnitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by ﬁnite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ‘universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable deﬁnition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

	abstract = {In a spin glass with Ising spins, the problems of computing the magnetic partition function and finding a ground state are studied. In a finite two-dimensional lattice these problems can be solved by algorithms that require a number of steps bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the lattice. In contrast to this fact, the same problems are shown to belong to the class of w-hard problems, both in the two-dimensional case within a magnetic field, and in the three-dimensional case. Np-hardness of a problem suggests that it is very unlikely that a polynomial algorithm could exist to solve it.},

	abstract = {I chart the considerable changes in the status and conception of the Lenz-Ising model from 1920 to 1950 in terms of three phases: In the early 1920s, Lenz and Ising introduced the model in the ﬁeld of ferromagnetism. Based on an exact derivation, Ising concluded that it is incapable of displaying ferromagnetic behavior, a result he erroneously extended to three dimensions. In the next phase, Lenz and Ising’s contemporaries rejected the model as a representation of ferromagnetic materials because of its conﬂict with the new quantum mechanics. In the third phase, from the early 1930s to the early 1940s, the model was revived as a model of cooperative phenomena. I provide more detail on this history than the earlier accounts of Brush (1967) and Hoddeson, Schubert, Heims, and Baym (1992) and question some of their conclusions. Moreover, my account differs from these in its focus on the development of the model in its capacity as a model. It examines three aspects of this development: (1) the attitudes on the degree of physical realism of the Lenz-Ising model in its representation of physical phenomena; (2) the various reasons for studying and using it; and (3) the effect of the change in its theoretical basis during the transition from the old to the new quantum mechanics. A major theme of my study is that even though the Lenz-Ising model is not fully realistic, it is more useful than more realistic models because of its mathematical tractability. I argue that this point of view, important for the modern conception of the model, is novel and that its emergence, while perhaps not a consequence of its study, is coincident with the third phase of its development.},

I will summarize the Bell-type experiments and what Nature responded, and discuss the implications for the physical quantities considered, the real entities and the nonlocality concept due to Bell’s work. Subsequently, I also explain a quite diﬀerent view of the meaning of a quantum state, this is the information theoretic approach, focusing on the work of Brukner and Zeilinger. Finally, I would like to broaden and contrast the reality discussion with the concept of “virtuality,” with the meaning of virtual particle occurring in quantum ﬁeld theory.

	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms are believed to be promising for solving computationally hard problems and are often comprised of repeated layers of quantum gates. An example thereof is the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), an approach to solve combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. Gaining computational power from QAOA critically relies on the mitigation of errors during the execution of the algorithm, which for coherence-limited operations is achievable by reducing the gate count. Here, we demonstrate an improvement of up to a factor of 3 in algorithmic performance as measured by the success probability, by implementing a continuous hardware-efficient gate set using superconducting quantum circuits. This gate set allows us to perform the phase separation step in QAOA with a single physical gate for each pair of qubits instead of decomposing it into two C\$Z\$-gates and single-qubit gates. With this reduced number of physical gates, which scales with the number of layers employed in the algorithm, we experimentally investigate the circuit-depth-dependent performance of QAOA applied to exact-cover problem instances mapped onto three and seven qubits, using up to a total of 399 operations and up to 9 layers. Our results demonstrate that the use of continuous gate sets may be a key component in extending the impact of near-term quantum computers.},

	abstract = {We introduce quantum fluctuations into the simulated annealing process of optimization problems, aiming at faster convergence to the optimal state. The idea is tested by the two models, the transverse Ising model and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Adding the transverse field to the Ising model is a simple way to introduce quantum fluctuations. The strength of the transverse field is controlled as a function of time similarly to the temperature in the conventional method. TSP can be described by the Ising spin, so that we also apply the same technique to TSP. We directory solve the time-dependent Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation for small-size systems and perform the quantum Monte Carlo simulation for large-size systems. Comparison with the results of the corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum method leads to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use the same annealing schedule of the control parameters. We also find that the relaxation time is quite short for quantum systems by numerical simulations. We consider this is one of the reasons why the annealing in quantum systems have a better performance of finding the optimal state in comparison with classical systems.},

The equivalence between the models provides a new vantage point from which to tackle the central issues in quantum computation, namely designing new quantum algorithms and constructing fault tolerant quantum computers. In particular, by translating the main open questions in the area of quantum algorithms to the language of spectral gaps of sparse matrices, the result makes these questions accessible to a wider scientific audience, acquainted with mathematical physics, expander theory and rapidly mixing Markov chains.},

As a bonus of capacity-qubits, one also obtains a description of state, which allows us to set a variety of traveling rules, depending on each state of vehicles.

That work of Lenz and Ising marked the start of a scientific direction that, over nearly 100 years, delivered extraordinary successes in explaining collective behaviour in a vast variety of systems, both within and beyond the natural sciences. The broadness of the appeal of the Ising model is reflected in the variety of talks presented at the Ising lectures ( http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/ising/ ) over the past two decades but requires that we restrict this report to a small selection of topics. The paper starts with some personal memoirs of Thomas Ising (Ernst's son). We then discuss the history of the model, exact solutions, experimental realisations, and its extension to other fields.},

The silicon chip is composed of a mesh of computing cells. Each cell includes both analog and digital circuits and includes two photosensors. A detailed analysis of this cell is given including a presentation of the design constraints. A 4/spl times/4-cells prototype chip was implemented in a 1 /spl mu/m CMOS digital technology and was successfully operated at 20000 iterations per second. The measurements and characterization of this chip made possible the successful design of a 600-cells chip also presented. These results demonstrate the video-rate application of simulated annealing to early vision tasks.},

	abstract = {An online advertisement optimization, which can be represented by a combinatorial optimization problem is performed using D-Wave 2000Q, a quantum annealing machine. To optimize the online advertisement allocation optimization, we introduce a generalized version of the Markowitz mean-variance model which is a basic model of portfolio optimization. The obtained optimization performance using D-Wave 2000Q is higher than that using the greedy method which is a conventional method. Additionally, to conveniently use Ising machines including a quantum annealing machine, new software called PyQUBO is developed. The first half of the paper gives a review of several combinatorial optimization problems and how to represent them using the Ising model or the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form. We show the results of the online advertisement allocation optimization and the explanation of PyQUBO in the last half of the paper.},
